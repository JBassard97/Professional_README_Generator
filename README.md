## Description

This repo contains a folder with the "index.js" file that runs a node application to help you create your project's README way faster! Simply follow the prompts and be sure to have all of the projects information handy!

## Installation

You'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine to use this file, and it's recommended to have the latest version downloaded. As long as you have that, this will work with no issues.

## Usage

Link to the repo: https://github.com/JBassard97/Professional_README_Generator
After cloning this repo, you will see a folder titled "Professional_README_Generator" and an "index.js" file within it. To begin the application, right-click the folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal." Then enter: `node index.js`. From there, answer the questions given one at a time. You can even choose to omit certain sections if you really feel that they aren't necessary for your project's README! At the end, you'll recieve a brief preview of your README in the terminal and the real thing will appear directly next to the "index.js" file! This generator will always use professional formatting and indentations, so no worries there! If insist on immediately opening a preview of your new creation, I recommend you directly open the README first and saving so there are no errors loading it.
